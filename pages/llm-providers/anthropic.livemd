# Anthropic

```elixir
Mix.install(
  [
    {:instructor, path: Path.expand("../../", __DIR__)},
  ]
)
```

## Introduction

Anthropic is a leading AI lab that competes with both OpenAI and Google.  Their models rank among the top, though their pricing is a little more expensive.  Lucky for you, we support them out of the box.  All you need to do is create an account with [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) and get an API key.

There are three ways to configure Instructor to use Anthropic.

1. via `Mix.install([...], [instructor: [adapter: Instructor.Adapters.Anthropic, anthropic: [...]]])`
2. via `config :instructor, adapter: Instructor.Adapters.Anthropic, anthropic: [...]`
3. At runtime via `Instructor.chat_completion(..., config)`

For brevity, in this livebook, we'll configure it at runtime

```elixir
config = [
  adapter: Instructor.Adapters.Anthropic,
  api_key: System.fetch_env!("LB_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
]

defmodule President do
  use Ecto.Schema

  @primary_key false
  embedded_schema do
    field(:first_name, :string)
    field(:last_name, :string)
    field(:entered_office_date, :date)
  end
end

Instructor.chat_completion(
  [
    model: "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
    mode: :tools,
    max_tokens: 1000,
    response_model: President,
    messages: [
      %{role: "user", content: "Who was the first president of the United States?"}
    ]
  ],
  config
)
```
